# xpdraw
xpdraw is a library for X-Plane plugins which aims to simplify certain OpenGL and X-Plane functions. It is still in early development, and as a result, things are extremely likely to change.

**Note:** In its current state, xpdraw crashes the sim with no hints whenever it runs into an error such as being unable to load a texture. This will be fixed in the future.

The include headers and static libraries are under the `export/` directory. The static libraries may not be up to date or match, in which case you may get the latest from [here](https://github.com/slimit75/xpdraw/actions).
Usage instructions will be added to a wiki as xpdraw becomes more complete.
