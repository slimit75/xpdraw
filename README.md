# xpdraw
xpdraw is a work in progress C++ library for X-Plane plugins with the goal of handing and simplifying XPLM and OpenGL functions. 

## Notes
- The sim will currently crash if a texture is unable to be loaded.
- It is still early in development - things are likely to change and break with no notice
